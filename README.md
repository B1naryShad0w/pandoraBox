# Pandora Box
The Pandora Box is a Raspberry Pi based Pandora Radio player. You are able to use buttons to interact with the Raspberry Pi, being able to pause, skip, like, and dislike songs, as well as other fuctions. It includes a 20x4 LCD display so you are able to see what song is currently playing and the artist.

*Note: This project is not built with reproduction in mind. It is built with the intent of being a gift for a friend of mine. The project might not work as it should if it is replicated and not setup properly. However, if you know what you're doing, it shouldn't be too difficult to set things up right.*
